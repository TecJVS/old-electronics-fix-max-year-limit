# old-electronics-fix-max-year-limit
Some old electronic devices can not store the current year in their digital calendar anymore, therefore this Python script can calculate an earlier year for which day, month and weekday match for as many days as possible with those in the current year. This is useful if you still would like to have the correct day, month and weekday (but not the year) i.e. shown on a LCD display. Disclaimer: I do not take any responsibility. Use at your own risk.
